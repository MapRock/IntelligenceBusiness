You are generating a semantic description for a database table to be used in vector embeddings.

Inputs:
• Table Name: {table_name}
• Columns: {comma-separated column list}

Instructions:

1. Infer the business meaning of the table strictly from the table name and column names.
2. Do NOT assume knowledge of any specific database, vendor, or implementation.
3. Do NOT hallucinate measures, processes, or industries not implied by the names.
4. Describe what real-world entities the rows represent.
5. Explain how the table is typically used in analytics or reporting.
6. Mention identity stability (e.g., whether it represents persistent entities vs events).
7. Reference hierarchical or categorical structure if column names imply it.
8. Write in neutral semantic language suitable for ontology or knowledge graph alignment.

Output Requirements:

• Length: ~100 words (90–120 ideal)
• Single paragraph
• No bullet points
• No column list restatement
• No SQL or technical implementation language
• Focus on meaning, not structure
