# *** Update on June 28, 2024 ***

I will have the supplemental code posted by <b>July 8, 2024</b>. The book just released on June 21, 2024. I need to properly comment the code and do the final edits of documents.

As I mentioned in the book, the supplemental code is just sample code. It didn't discuss code in the book, but it was used to create the bulk of the 200+ figures in the book.
