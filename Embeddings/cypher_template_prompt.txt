Given this user prompt: {user_prompt}, \n and the following information between the [START] and [END] tags:

[START]
{query}
[END]

and variables I've already parsed from that information:

{variables}

Do this:

1. Try to extract from the user prompt objects that might serve as variable values.
2. Replace those variable values in the query where there are << >> tags.
3. Return only the formatted query. 

IMPORTANT: ONLY RETURN THE FORMATTED QUERY. NO COMMENTS.
