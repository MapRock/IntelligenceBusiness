How might it be possible for there to be a correlation between the price of oil in China and the consumption of water in Brazil. I'm asking you to brainstorm this, it might be a chain of cause and effect. Please offer a step by step explanation, and turtle file, and Cypher commands for my Knowledge Graph implemented as a Neo4j database. The relationships should have a label of CAUSES and a description property and the nodes (events) with a label of Event and a description of the event.
