Go to fourier.py and look for this code:

    # Identify dominant frequencies in the Intel stock data
    # This code is like Figure 136, except INTC is used instead of MON.
    array2 = dominant_frequencies(df, 'Date', stock)
    print(array2)

This will show Figure 136. However, it shows for INTC, not MON - since I didn't include MON in stock_closes.csv.
