In a dental office are dentists of varying specialties, hygienists, assistants, receptionists, etc. Could you create on ontology of the top specialties, the required credentials, a couple of tasks they perform, the central unit of work (visit), the procedures (including the most common codes and other properties of a typical procedure)? Could you please output in Cypher so I can load this into a graph database? Please output not just the roles, but a few examples of procedures associated with visits and how entities relate. I'm looking for breadth (breadth of roles and events) more than depth (depth of procedure codes). Please relate that the roles are for humans is a node and relate a dental visit to an appointment node (a kind of).
