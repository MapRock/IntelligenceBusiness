Consider a few examples of common performance problems with SQL Server. Each problem involves looking through metrics that could be found in Performance Monitor. Could you create a graph of metrics relating to your examples and how they might affect each other. For example more RAM raises buffer pool, which lowers paging. Please include Cypher code that generates a graph of these relationships. And include a description property for each relationship in a way that indicates the effect of the from node increasing. The number of examples should provide a good demonstration of how a metric can affect multiple other metrics. The description properties of nodes and relationships should be enough such that a user of the graph is able to search for information about a SQL Server problem using some form of NLP interface.
