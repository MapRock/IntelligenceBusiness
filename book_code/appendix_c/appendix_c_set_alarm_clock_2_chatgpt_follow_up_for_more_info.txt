To generate the Prolog code for your wake-up alarm system, I'll need some additional information to accurately reflect your requirements. Here are some questions to help clarify the details:

Work Schedule:

How do you determine if you need to go to the office or if you can work from home? Is this information available in your outlook calendar, or is there a specific pattern or rule you follow?
What is considered "getting home late" from work? Do you have a specific time, e.g., after 8pm, that determines if you got home late?
Meeting Information:

Are the meetings you refer to all listed in your outlook calendar?
Is there a specific way to distinguish between personal and work meetings in your calendar, or should all meetings be treated the same for the purposes of setting your alarm?
Weekend Appointments:

Are weekend appointments also listed in your outlook calendar?
Gym Routine:

Do you have a consistent gym schedule, or should the system always set your alarm to 6am on weekdays if you can work from home?
Once I have this information, I'll be able to create a Prolog program for your wake-up alarm system and explain it in simple terms, along with examples of how to query it.

Please provide the answers to the above questions so I can proceed with generating the Prolog code.
