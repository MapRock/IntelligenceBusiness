In the event of a very large volcanic eruption, on the scale of the Icelandic one a few years ago, what are some not obvious effects (for example a nearby town showered by lava and ash) or something else well beyond our control (such as a super-volcano eruption at Yellowstone)? From that Icelandic eruption, there are certainly lessons. Please consider the large volcanic eruption as a rare event object of a knowledge graph, and the effects you mention as relationships to that rare event. What is being affected? What can be done to mitigate the effect of the unpredictable eruption? Please output as a turtle file with effects related to the rare event and mitigation related to the effect.
