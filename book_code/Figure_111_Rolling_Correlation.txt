Look in src/spearman_peason.py and look for this code:

	# Plot and show correlations, both Pearson and Spearman
	# This is Figure 111.
	correlations = plot_correlations(df, use_pct_change=True, show_plot=True, pearson=True, spearman=True)

If you run spearman_pearson.py directly, the visualization of Figure 111 will show up last.
