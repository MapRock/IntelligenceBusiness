Can you help me create an RDF ontology in Turtle format for a typical restaurant workflow? I need it to include a hierarchy of classes that represent the essential steps in a restaurant's customer service process, such as greeting, seating, presenting the menu, taking orders, preparing food, serving, and processing payments. Each of these steps should be defined as a class and should be a subclass of a general 'RestaurantWorkflow' class. Also, include object properties to show the sequence of these steps and their interaction with the 'Customer' class. Additionally, I'd like to have each step represented as an individual instance of its respective class, showing the workflow progression. Please use standard RDF, OWL, and RDFS vocabularies, and leave room for potential future expansion like feedback collection and customer service. Include basic prefixes like rdf, owl, and xsd.
